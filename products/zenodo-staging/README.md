# Staging to Zenodo 

All products are hosted on [this Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4498438), which is administered by Ian Czekala.

We can make test staging uploads to Zenodo's sandbox. At the time of writing, we were using this [test repository](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/794572) but because repositories on the sandbox can be cleaned at any time, there's no guarantee that it will be there in the future (and so will need to be recreated).
